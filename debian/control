Description: package manager for WINE to install software easily
 A POSIX shell script 'package manager' for WINE to install some
 Windows software easily. The list contains about 70 applications
 including 3dmark2001, corefonts, cygwin, directx9, dotnet35, droid,
 firefox, flash, ie8, mspaint, msxml6, python26, quicktime76, safari,
 spotify, utorrent, vb6run, vcrun2010, vlc, xvid etc.
 .
 About pckages in Recommends header: to use GUI progress bar, install
 package "zenity". To read manuals, install package "xdg-utils". If
 you need to cache any *.iso files with the -k option, install package
 "sudo" or sudo GUI "gksu".
 .
 NOTE: This package suggests installing package libwine. Some, but not
 all package downloads depend on restarting the wineserver which is
 included in libwine.
 .
 NOTE: In case you have compiled wine from sources and installed it
 out of dpkg(1)'s control, winetricks' depends wouldn't know about it. In
 that case create a "dummy wine" package to satisfy depends by using
 tools in "equivs" package before installing winetricks. An example:
 .
   git clone git@github.com:jaalto/project--debian-wine-dummy.git
   cd project--debian-wine-dummy
   make
   dpkg -i wine*.deb
   apt-get install winetricks
