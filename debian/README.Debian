If wine is installed, it's wine binary and wineserver are used, even
if wine-development is installed. The wine-development wine binary and
wineserver are only used if just wine-development is installed.
.
If you have both wine and wine-development installed and you want to
use the wine-development wine binary and wineserver, you should execute
the following commands before running winetricks.
.
  export WINE=/usr/bin/wine-development
  export WINESERVER=/usr/bin/wineserver-development

About packages in Recommends header: to use GUI progress bar, install
package "zenity". To read manuals, install package "xdg-utils". If
you need to cache any *.iso files with the -k option, install package
"sudo" or sudo GUI "gksu".
.
NOTE: This package suggests installing package libwine. Some, but not
all package downloads depend on restarting the wineserver which is
included in libwine.
.
NOTE: In case you have compiled wine from sources and installed it
out of dpkg(1)'s control, winetricks' depends wouldn't know about it. In
that case create a "dummy wine" package to satisfy depends by using
tools in "equivs" package before installing winetricks. An example:
.
  git clone https://github.com/jaalto/project--debian-wine-dummy.git
  cd project--debian-wine-dummy
  make
  dpkg -i wine*.deb
  apt-get install winetricks

Wine setup / before using winetricks

	Most of the software is 32bit only, so if you have 64bit OS,
	consider setting:

	    export WINEARCH=win32

	before initializing wine; before ~/.wine is created. This
	prevents wine being structured as a 64-bit installation and
	allows winetricks to work. Refer to LP#1006909 for more
	information:
