Wine setup / before using winetricks

	Most of the software is 32bit only, so if you have 64bit OS,
	consider setting:

	    export WINEARCH=win32

	before initializing wine; before ~/.wine is created. This
	prevents wine being structured as a 64-bit installation and
	allows winetricks to work. Refer to LP#1006909 for more
	information:
